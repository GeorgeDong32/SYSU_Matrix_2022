# Description

First, write a base class ``animal`` in animal.h, which has 2 attributes: ``string  _species`` and ``int  _eyes``. This class
should also have a method: ``void print_eyes()``, which can printf "species has _eyes eyes." on screen.

Then, you are required to write a ``human`` class which is an inheritance class of`` animal``. Its ``_species`` should always be "Human" and of course we have 2 eyes. The human class has an extra attribute: ``string  _name``. And it is able to say hello to us with an extra method, ``void greeting()`` : "Hello, I'm _name."
