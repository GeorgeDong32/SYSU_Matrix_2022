# Description
Recall the "Point" class before, we want to create ```TwoDPoint``` class to model a point in a two-dimensional space.(Default value ```(0,0)```, ```int```).
It has functions to get its coordinates ```getX()```, ```getY()``` and a member function to calculate the distance between it and another TwoDPoint ```distance```(return type ```double```).

Based on ```TwoDPoint```, create a class named ```ThreeDPoint``` to model a point in a three-dimensional space.```x```, ```y```, ```z``` represent x-, y- and z-coordinates(Default value ```(0,0,0)```, ```int```).Let ```ThreeDPoint``` be derived from ```TwoDPoint```, adding function ```getZ()``` and overload the member function```distance```.

# Hint
Get to know details in ```framework.cpp``` and try to separate declaration and definition in ```Points.h``` and ```Points.cpp``` .
