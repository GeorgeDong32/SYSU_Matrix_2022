Compared with C, reference is one characteristic of C++. To some degree, using reference can reduce codes because you do not need to use '\*'. Now there are there functions
```
void use_value(int a, int b);
void use_pointer(int* a, int* b);
void use_reference(int& a, int& b);
```

You need to implement functions above to get outputs below.


#### Input
```
1 2
```

#### Output
```
1 2 
Original Value
1 2
Swap by using value
1 2
Swap by using pointer
2 1
Swap by using reference
1 2
```
